Hi, I'm Tomás Canilhas. I'm a Computer Science Student at Faculdade de Ciências da Universidade de Lisboa. I enjoy creating little projects, and at this moment this is one of them. Here I pretend to show some of my projects, from Apps, Games and even some school projects.

Now talking a little bit more about my hobbies, besides programming, I enjoy playing video games, going out with friends. During my whole I played some type of sport, Table Tennis, Volleyball, Futsal.
I always like to accept a challenge, sometimes it works out sometimes it doesn't it happens.
